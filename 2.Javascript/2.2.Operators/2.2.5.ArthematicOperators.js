//What are the arithmetic operators in JavaScript?
//Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers. There are several arithmetic operators in JavaScript:
    //1. + (Addition): Adds two operands.
    //2. - (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
    //3. * (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.
    //4. / (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
    //5. % (Modulus): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
    //6. ++ (Increment): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
    //7. -- (Decrement): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
    //8. ** (Exponentiation): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

//Example :1
console.log(5 + 3); // 8

//Example :2

console.log(5 - 3); // 2


//Example :3

console.log(5 * 3); // 15

//Example :4

console.log(5 / 3); // 1.6666666666666667

//Example :5

console.log(5 % 3); // 2

//Example :6

let h = 5;
h++;
console.log(h); // 6

//Example :7

let i = 5;
i--;
console.log(i); // 4

//Example :8

console.log(5 ** 3); // 125
